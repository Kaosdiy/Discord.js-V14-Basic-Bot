# Discord.js-V14-Basic-Bot
This is a extremely simple Discord bot.

# Setup
To setup this bot you must first have a discord application created. For this go to [discord.dev](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in your browser. From there click on "New Application" and give it a name! From there navigate to the "Bot" tab and click on "Copy Token" If this isnt your first time making a bot it may ask you to "Reset Token".

One you have got your token navigate to your .env.example file and change `TOKEN = Your Token Here` to your bots token. 
Make sure not to share your token as this allows anyone to control your bot.

After this all you have to do is run `npm i discord.js` in the console. 
If you are unsure on how to open the console click ` or the button above your tab key.

After all of this you can run your bot by simple typing `node index.js`
